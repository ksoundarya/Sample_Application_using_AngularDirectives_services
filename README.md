# Sample_Application_using_AngularDirectives_services

Simple Business Application using angularized Html, Custom Directives and Services 

It would be difficult to test the visual representation of the component, but there are many functional aspects of this component that are worthy testing, for instance:
  
 -- does it render correct structure (eg. navigation and content for each pane)
 -- does the binding inside the content works
 -- is the first tab selected by default
 -- Should submit/send business details to save, and return success or errors
